Among Hindus, as the etymology of deodar suggests, it is worshiped as a divine tree. Deva, the first half of the Sanskrit term, means divine, deity, or deus. DƒÅru, the second part, is cognate with (related to) the words durum, druid, tree, and true.[24][self-published source?] Several Hindu legends refer to this tree. For example, Valmiki Ramayan reads:[27]

In the stands of Lodhra trees,[28] Padmaka trees [29] and in the woods of Devadaru, or Deodar trees, Ravana is to be searched there and there, together with Sita. [4-43-13]

The deodar is the national tree of Pakistan,[30] and the state tree of Himachal Pradesh, India.

Under the Deodars was an 1889 short story collection by Rudyard Kipling.[31]

The 1902 musical A Country Girl featured a song called "Under the Deodar."
