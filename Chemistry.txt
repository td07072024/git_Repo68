The bark of Cedrus deodara contains large amounts of taxifolin.[4] The wood contains cedeodarin, ampelopsin, cedrin, cedrinoside,[5] and deodarin (3′,4′,5,6-tetrahydroxy-8-methyl dihydroflavonol).[6] The main components of the needle essential oil include α-terpineol (30.2%), linalool (24.47%), limonene (17.01%), anethole (14.57%), caryophyllene (3.14%), and eugenol (2.14%).[7] The deodar cedar also contains lignans[8] and the phenolic sesquiterpene himasecolone, together with isopimaric acid.[9] Other compounds have been identified, including (−)-matairesinol, (−)-nortrachelogenin, and a dibenzylbutyrolactollignan (4,4',9-trihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-9,9'-epoxylignan).[10]
